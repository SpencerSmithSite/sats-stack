/// Bridges Apple's on-device language model to Dart.

/// Shared by the iOS and macOS runners — one file, symlinked into
/// `macos/Runner/` and referenced from both Xcode projects, rather than two
/// copies. The framework, the availability rules and the channel contract are
/// identical on both platforms, and a divergence between two copies would be
/// invisible until one platform silently stopped offering the model. Only the
/// Flutter module name differs, which is what the `#if os(iOS)` above handles.
///
/// The framework arrived in iOS 26 / macOS 26 and this app's deployment targets
/// are older, so every entry point is guarded twice: `canImport` so the app
/// still compiles against an older SDK, and `#available` so it still launches
/// on an older OS. Without both, adding this makes the app fail to build or
/// fail to start for everyone who cannot use it.
///
/// Availability is asked of the framework rather than inferred. A version check
/// is wrong in both directions — Apple Intelligence needs A17 Pro or newer
/// silicon, so an iOS 26 iPhone 15 Pro qualifies while an iOS 27 iPhone 14 does
/// not — and the framework's own `unavailable` reason is the only thing that
/// distinguishes "your device cannot" from "you have not switched it on", which
/// are different problems for the user to fix.
